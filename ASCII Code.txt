ASCII Code

ASCII, which stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a character encoding scheme that assigns a unique code to each character.

The ASCII character set consists of 128 unique characters.

These characters include uppercase and lowercase alphabets, numerals, punctuation marks, control characters, and special symbols such as currency signs.

* Different ASCII Code Representations :

1-Alphabets: The uppercase alphabets are represented by codes 65 to 90, while the lowercase alphabets are represented by codes 97 to 122.
This allows computers to differentiate between uppercase and lowercase letters.
EX: The letter 'A' is represented by 65.
    The letter 'a' is represented by 97.


2-Numbers: The numerical digits 0 to 9 are represented by codes 48 to 57. These codes enable the storage and processing of numeric data in computer systems.
 EX: The number '1' is represented by 49.

3-Symbols: ASCII codes include a wide range of symbols such as punctuation marks, currency signs, mathematical symbols, and more.
EX: The exclamation mark is represented by  33, and the dollar sign is represented by 36.


4-Control Characters: ASCII codes also include control characters that donâ€™t have a visible representation but are used to control certain aspects of data transmission and processing.
These control characters have codes ranging from 0 to 31, and 127.
EX: Include the newline character (code 10) and the carriage return (code 13).
